## Change of Scale
**2009**

The famale ideal, the model was with us since we were kids, and created a sort of pressure, an urge to be just like them. The ideal we had as a child, the “what will I be when I grow up” and the realization **{TODO: that we were lied to}**. We try to become the unobtainable and I draw a parallel to it with myself.
