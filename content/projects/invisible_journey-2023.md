# Invisible Journey (2023)
**Pannonhalma 04.05.2023 - 11.11.2023**

A pilgrimage within myself: mapping the past. I look back on my own life from the present, a journey in which I am being aided by a professional, a therapist. With this help, I am unraveling my memories and trying to put them in order. The imprints of the inner journey (back) are invisibly displayed on the wall; an ultraviolet lamp gives visitors insight into the work in progress.

Material: UV paint, UV lamp, mirror box with sign.
